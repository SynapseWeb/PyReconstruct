* Questions for Julian
- Is /src/pyrecon necessary?
- Are transformations stored as coefficients or real matrices?
- We should try this on TACC just to see if we can.
- Written tutorial? Quickstart tutorial?
- We need to learn more about QT in general
- Exporting obj data as csv and json
- Can we do a simple 3D scene for vanilla pyReconstruct and something more instense for Blender?
* High-priority tasks

- [ ] Take a look at SynapseWeb recon2ng
- [ ] Visualize in 3D in Blender / Neuroglancer
- [ ] Cool "3D" or automated tool (Cutting off spines? Import to Blender?)
- [ ] Calibration
- [ ] Add tags to objects
- [ ] Object list
   - [ ] Limit output (regular expressions?)
   - [ ] "Live" object list update (no need to refresh list constantly)
   - [ ] Limit to object tags
   - [ ] Check box / selected?
- [ ] Consider transformation module for upcoming transformational armaggeddon (spelling?) 

* Low-priority tasks

- [ ] In-program Python console
- [ ] Add-on / extension menu / API?
- [ ] Make hotkeys editable by user
- [ ] Give user option of selection number of RAM-loaded images
- [ ] CTRL-c items from the object this for easy pasting into Excel
- [ ] Change stamp into a different shape
- [ ] Sort object list in a variety of ways (by section number, tag, etc.)

* Crazy ideas

- [ ] Be able to view 3D "building" in Blender as you're tracing
- [ ] Export images and traces as SVG file
- [ ] Be able to rotate the section in z inside Reconstruct
- [ ] Compendium of regular expressions

* Things to consider

- (Vijay) Saving points as .obj file / function to export to .obj
- (Vijay) Objects pointing to an obj file instead of sections
- 3D numpy arrays for autoseg
- Export to zarr?
- Boolean arrays to store object data

* Lab meeting 20220901
** Intro
*** Summer "mini" project

- New understanding of Reconstruct machinations
- "Reconstruct-parallel" tools
- ? Integrate tools into "Reconstruct"
- But in Python
- Minimize hubris
- Most basic Reconstruct function?

*** Original primary goal

Draw lines on images using *Python*???

*** Updated goals post-wow factor

Let's keep the good times going!
  
- Keep spirit of "legacy" Reconstruct
- Simple and ports to/from legacy Reconstruct
- Capitalize on previous work (Larry and Michael)
- Incorporate with autosegmentation efforts (Vijay)
  
*** How?

- Prioritized major Reconstruct functions 
- Moved down list sequentially
- How far can we get?
  
*** This presentation

- Full demo of *pyReconstruct*
- 100% Python (3 months)
- v0.0.-2
- Super basic / unpolished GUI
- Reconstuct tool emulation
- Questions at end
  
** Demo (Michael shuts up)

- Open py-reconstruct and start new series
  
- Demo tools
  
   + Trace object
   + Stamp
   + Scalpel
   + Undo / redo
   + Merge
   + Pan / Zoom
   + Obj list / autorefreshing
   + Importing "SWiFT" transformations
   + Exporting back to legacy Reconstruct
   + Importing a series from legacy Reconstruct
   + Imports zarr files
     
- Explanation (think about differences with legacy Reconstruct)
  
   + PyQT, numpy, openCV
   + JSON structure (XML contrasted with the same JSON)
   + Transformations
   + Point storage (consider simplifying trace points on series import)
   + Merge differences
   + Things are good about Reconstruct
     
** Future / Summary
*** pyReconstruct advantages

- Not fixed (adaptable) - Reconstruct wish-list (e.g., scalpel, auto-refreshing object list, redo)
- Extensible / customizable / new tools on the fly (e.g., variable-radius circles)
- Integration with team Vijay
- Cross-platform (e.g., run in Linux, TACC)
     
*** Future
  
- 3D in Blender
- API (application programming interface)
- VC with git / automatic backing up

*** Personal growth

- Team work
- VC, git, gitHub, gitHub Desktop
- Managing dependencies
- Linux
- Programming skills

*** Q and A

- Soft balls to Michael
- Hard questions to Julian
** Notes
- Redo / undo per section
- Consider history / state tab
- Consider logging in as UTeID
- Dependency-free environment?
- Keep pyReconstruct slim!
