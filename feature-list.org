- [ ] pyReconstruct walk-through: Friday, July 15
- [ ] Next Vijay meeting: Monday, August 1

* High-priority tasks

- [ ] Trace list
- [ ] Expandable (s) / grabbable (g) traces (left click = confirm, right click = cancel)
- [ ] Come up with style

* Must-do

- [ ] Run on mac / linux machine
- [ ] SWiFT integration (extension?)
- [ ] Investigate using zarr (as "images" and "points")
- [ ] Test dim 6 XML import

* Medium-priority tasks

- [ ] Setup files (setup.py)
- [ ] Knife tool
- [ ] Reconcropper
- [ ] Image contrast / brightness
- [ ] Z-traces
- [ ] Take a look at SynapseWeb recon2ng
- [ ] Visualize in 3D in Blender / Neuroglancer
- [ ] Cool "3D" or automated tool (Cutting off spines? Import to Blender?)
- [ ] Calibration
- [ ] Add tags to objects
- [ ] Object list
   - [ ] Limit output (regular expressions?)
   - [ ] Limit to object tags
   - [ ] Check box / selected?
- [ ] Consider transformation module for upcoming transformational armaggeddon (spelling?) 

* Low-priority tasks

- [ ] Export images and traces as SVG file
- [ ] In-program Python console
- [ ] Add-on / extension menu / API?
- [ ] Make hotkeys editable by user
- [ ] Give user option of selection number of RAM-loaded images
- [ ] CTRL-c items from the object this for easy pasting into Excel
- [ ] Change stamp into a different shape
- [ ] Sort object list in a variety of ways (by section number, tag, etc.)

* Crazy ideas

- [ ] Be able to view 3D "building" in Blender as you're tracing
- [ ] Be able to rotate the section in z inside Reconstruct
- [ ] Compendium of regular expressions

* Things to consider

- (Vijay) Saving points as .obj file / function to export to .obj
- (Vijay) Objects pointing to an obj file instead of sections
- 3D numpy arrays for autoseg
- Export to zarr?
- Boolean arrays to store object data
