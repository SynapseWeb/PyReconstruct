   - [X] Ctrl-numbers to access trace button attributes from the field

- [ ] Minor things
   - [ ] Fix import statements for dim 6 (Did we do this?)
   - [ ] Update object/contour/trace terminology throughout

- [ ] Other things
   - [ ] Give Michael a good reason why we can't get rid of trace names in json

- [ ] color?
- [ ] extensions (MC)

- [ ] Calibration
- [ ] Add tags to objects
- [ ] Object list
   - [ ] Limit output (regular expressions?)
   - [ ] "Live" object list update (no need to refresh list constantly)
   - [ ] Limit to object tags
   - [ ] Check box / selected?
- [ ] Consider transformation module for upcoming transformational armaggeddon (spelling?) 

* Low-priority tasks

- [ ] Can we "reserve" a color for seleted traces instead of making it dotted? (thiccccen)
- [ ] In-program Python console
- [ ] Add-on / extension menu / API?
- [ ] Make hotkeys editable by user
- [ ] Give user option of selection number of RAM-loaded images
- [ ] CTRL-c items from the object this for easy pasting into Excel
- [ ] Change stamp into a different shape
- [ ] Sort object list in a variety of ways (by section number, tag, etc.)
- [ ] Written tutorial / Quickstart tutorial

* Crazy ideas

- [ ] Be able to view 3D "building" in Blender as you're tracing
- [ ] Export images and traces as SVG file
- [ ] Be able to rotate the section in z inside Reconstruct
- [ ] Compendium of regular expressions

* Cute things
- Let user change black background color or to an image of their choosing
* Things to consider

- (Vijay) Saving points as .obj file / function to export to .obj
- (Vijay) Objects pointing to an obj file instead of sections
- 3D numpy arrays for autoseg
- Export to zarr?
- Boolean arrays to store object data
