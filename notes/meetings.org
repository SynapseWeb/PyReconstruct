* 20220908 NN1 meeting
** Intro
*** Summer "mini" project

- New understanding of Reconstruct machinations
- Reconstruct-parallel tools
- ? Integrate tools "Reconstruct"
- Minimize hubris
- Most basic Reconstruct function?

*** Original primary goal

Draw lines on images using *Python*???

*** Updated goals post-wow factor

Let's keep the good times going!
  
- Keep spirit of "legacy" Reconstruct
- Simple and ports to/from legacy Reconstruct
- Capitalize on previous work (Larry and Michael)
- Incorporate with autosegmentation efforts (Vijay)
  
*** How?

- Prioritized major Reconstruct functions 
- Moved down list sequentially
- How far can we get?
  
*** This presentation

- Full demo of *pyReconstruct*
- 100% Python (3 months)
- Super basic / unpolished GUI
- Reconstuct tool emulation
- Questions at end
  
** Demo (Michael shuts up)

- Open py-reconstruct and start new series
  
- Demo tools
  
   + Trace object
   + Stamp
   + Scalpel
   + Undo / redo
   + Merge
   + Pan / Zoom
   + Obj list / autorefreshing
   + Importing "SWiFT" transformations
   + Exporting back to legacy Reconstruct
   + Importing a series from legacy Reconstruct
   + Imports zarr files
     
- Explanation (think about differences with legacy Reconstruct)
  
   + PyQT, numpy, openCV
   + JSON structure (XML contrasted with the same JSON)
   + Transformations
   + Point storage (consider simplifying trace points on series import)
   + Merge differences
   + Things are good about Reconstruct
     
** Future / Summary
*** Advantages

- Not fixed (adaptable)
- Reconstruct wish-list (e.g., scalpel, auto-refreshing object list, redo)
- Extensible / customizable / new tools on the fly (e.g., variable-radius circles)
- Integration with team Vijay
- Cross-platform (e.g., run in Linux and Mac, TACC?)
     
*** Future
  
- 3D in Blender
- API / Console in program
- Next generation SWiFT transformations
- VC with git / automatic backing up
- Consider zarr format for image display

*** Personal growth

- NONE.
  
*** Q and A

- Soft balls to Michael
- Hard questions to Julian
  
** Notes
*** 20220901 Lab meeting

- Redo / undo per section
- Consider history / state tab
- Consider logging in as UTeID
- Dependency-free environment?
- Keep pyReconstruct slim!
  
*** 20220908 NN1 meeting

- Blender hotkeys
- ...
* 20220909 JF-VT-MC
** Potential autosegmentation paths
- Normal tracing
- Bush tool
* 20221004 Joel meeting

- Reconstruct

- Retrospective alignment

- PyReconstruct

- Get SWiFT working on local machine

- Question from lab meeting
  
   - Why are we using conda instead of venv?
   - Can we wrap new swift in a docker file

- SWiFT questions
  
   - Bounding box issue (translation issue)
   - Export transformations
  
- GUI questions
  
   - Python console in pyReconstruct
   - QtPy v. PySide2 v. Pyside6
   - TACC integration
   - Brightness/contrast
   - Qtwebengine
   - What things are on the horizon of GUI that we should look into
     
- Neuroglancer
  
   - How incorporated into SWiFT
   - 3D visualization
* 20221019 Lab meeting
** Version control
** Git
** GitHub
** Commands
*** What is a commit?
*** Staging area
*** Fetch
*** Pull
*** Main v. Branch
** Lynds
*** Get python
- Command prompt -> "python"
- Microsoft app store if no work
*** Make tools folder
*** Clone a repository
- Go to GitHub site
- Show readme 
*** Interact with it
*** Change something, push changes, and have her fetch/pull
*** Interact again
*** Get pyReconstruct
*** Get Recompanion
*** Delete test-repo through desktop GitHub
*** Start installing Recompanion while Julian starts
** Julian
* 20221130 KH-MC-JF Meeting
- Copy images onto desktop
- Start new series
- Walk through field widget (palettes)
- Walk through opening a series
- Open object list
- 3D (we know we can improve mesh)
- Scale cube
- z-traces
